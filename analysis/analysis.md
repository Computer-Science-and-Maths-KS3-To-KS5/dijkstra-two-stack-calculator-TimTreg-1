The aim of this project is to calculate the result of an infix equation, using brackets to indicate the order of precedence. This should allow a user to enter an equation, with each value in the equation separated by a space (e.g. ((1 + 2) * 3)) While humans are good at understanding operator precedence and brackets, computers require algorithms to parse and evaluate expressions correctly. 
A member of a primary school’s maths department requires an easy way to perform long calculations quickly by simply typing them in. They want to be able to enter a long, bracketed equation and for the code to output the result, so teachers can check students’ answers to more difficult questions.
This program should be able to handle the four basic operations: ‘+’, ‘-‘, ‘*’, ‘/’, will use dijkstra’s two stack algorithm, and demonstrate use of stacks
The output should be a single number representing the result of the evaluated expression
The expression is assumed to be fully parenthesized, space separated, and have no syntax errors (e.g. div 0)
Dijkstra’s two stack algorithm was chosen due to its simplicity and speed at solving fully parenthesized expressions, which make it helpful to this maths department which require a quick, non complex algorithm to solve equations

Objectives:
Can input a fully bracketed equation
Can successfully carry out addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
Can decipher order of precedence using brackets correctly
Can output correct result for user to see
